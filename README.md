#  Project: Guess the Number Game in Java

## Game Description:
- The user needs to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low, and continues until the user guesses the correct number.

## Explanation:
- Random Number Generation: The Random class generates a number between 1 and 100.
- User Input: The program uses Scanner to take user input for guesses.
- Feedback Loop: The program provides feedback based on the guess (too low, too high, or correct).
- Exit Condition: The game ends when the correct number is guessed, and the number of attempts is displayed.

# Project : Student Information System with Data Structures (Intermediate Project)

## Project Description:
- This is a Student Information System where student details are stored, and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are performed using OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and DSA (Data Structures) concepts. The data is stored in a custom LinkedList structure and performs searching using Binary Search Trees (BST) for efficient data retrieval.

- This project demonstrates both OOP principles and DSA concepts, which can be added to your resume. The project features the following:

- OOP Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
- DSA Concepts: Linked List, Binary Search Tree (BST), Searching and Sorting.

## Explanation: 
## OOP Concepts:

- Encapsulation: Student details (ID, name, department, grade) are encapsulated in the Student class.
- Inheritance: Not used explicitly here, but could be expanded by having a GraduateStudent class inheriting from Student.
- Polymorphism: Could be applied by overriding methods for different types of students (e.g., part-time, full-time).
- Abstraction: Methods like addStudent() and searchStudentById() hide the implementation details.

## DSA Concepts:

- Linked List: A custom linked list is used to store and manage students.
- Binary Search Tree: BST is used for efficient searching of students by their ID.
